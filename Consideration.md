Thanks. Your consideration is valuable. But we must from music to generate "a single" connected trianglized spacetime. And I think the music really should treat like a discreted spacetime. 您知道的，生成性构成了音乐。如果我们不保持连续的生成性，那么其不应当在句法上被认为是同一首歌。但是是否在语义上可以认为是同一首歌，是值得哲学上的讨论的。

Do not build connectivity from geometry.

Build geometry from generativity.
